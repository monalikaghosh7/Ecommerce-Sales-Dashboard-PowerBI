## 🔍 Key Inventory Insights

| 🚨 Business Problem | 🔎 Insight / Explanation | ✅ Recommended Solution |
|---------------------|--------------------------|-------------------------|
| 🔁 **Overstocking of Low-Performing Items** | Sub-categories like **Bookcases** or **Tables** appear frequently during loss-making months, indicating unsold stock. | Improve demand forecasting and reduce procurement of such items. |
| ⌛ **Slow-moving Inventory** | High sales but **low profits** in quarters like Q2 suggest deep **discounting or poor sell-through** of older stock. | Conduct inventory turnover analysis; run clearance campaigns for older stock. |
| 📉 **High Return or Damage Rate (Implied by Negative Profits)** | **Negative profits** in months like **May**, **July**, and **December** may imply high returns, spoilage, or quality issues. | Track product-level return rates; invest in **better packaging** and **quality control**. |
| 🔍 **Lack of Visibility into Inventory by Category** | No clear stock-level data visible for high-selling categories like **Clothing** (62.62% of quantity sold). | Implement SKU-level tracking through an inventory dashboard. |
| 🏷️ **Unsynchronized Sales & Inventory Planning** | High-performing sub-categories like **Printers** may face **stockouts** if not replenished in time. | Align procurement with real-time sales data using predictive analytics. |
| 📆 **Seasonal Demand Not Mapped to Inventory** | Losses in festive months (**October**, **December**) may indicate poor seasonal planning. | Use historical sales to plan seasonal inventory stocking. |
| 💸 **Cash Flow Issues due to Overstocking & COD** | High COD preference (43.74%) combined with unsold inventory affects **working capital**. | Promote prepaid options; optimize capital by clearing non-moving inventory. |
